Raj Rani Project

This website project was initially developed for a client seeking a sleek and modern online presence for their Indian takeaway business to attract more customers. The site was originally built using React and SCSS, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design. Later, it underwent a significant renovation with the integration of Next.js, enhancing its performance, SEO capabilities, and overall user experience.
